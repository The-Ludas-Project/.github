# Contributing to The Ludas Project

First off, thank you for your interest in contributing! Ludas is built on a philosophy of simplicity and control. To maintain this, we have a clear set of expectations for all contributors.

## Our Philosophy
Before submitting a Pull Request, remember:
* **Simple > Clever**: Code must be readable.
* **Explicit > Magical**: No hidden abstractions.
* **Minimalist > Bloated**: We provide the foundation; the user builds the skyscraper.

## How You Can Help
We welcome contributions that align with our core goals. Specifically:

* **Improving Code Clarity**: Making the existing logic easier to follow.
* **Fixing Bugs**: Squashing issues while maintaining API stability.
* **Refactoring**: Improving the internal structure without changing external behavior.
* **Focused Features**: Adding small, high-impact tools that stay within the project's scope.
* **Documentation**: Improving guides, comments, and examples to help other developers.

## What to Avoid
To keep the project lean and maintainable, please **do not**:

1. **Submit Massive Rewrites**: Large architectural changes must be discussed in an Issue first.
2. **Add Heavy Dependencies**: We aim to keep the footprint small. External libraries should be a last resort.
3. **Over-Engineer**: Do not turn Ludas into a "framework of frameworks." Keep it focused.

## Pull Request Process
1. **Open an Issue**: For anything other than a typo or minor bug fix, please open an issue to discuss your idea first.
2. **Follow the Style**: Match the existing codebase's indentation, naming conventions, and simplicity.
3. **Be Descriptive**: Explain *why* the change is necessary and *how* it improves the project.

**Simple API → Simple Code → Fun Games.**
