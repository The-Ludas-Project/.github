# The Ludas Project
### "Let's go make games."

The Ludas Project was born from a simple realization: the gap between "hardcore graphics programming" and "bloated game engines" has become a canyon. We are here to bridge it.

We believe that game development should be about **logic, creativity, and control** not fighting with heavy abstractions or mandatory editors.

### The Philosophy
Ludas is more than just code, it is a commitment to a specific way of building:

* **Simple > Clever:** If you can't read it, it doesn't belong here. 
* **Explicit > Magical:** You call the functions; the functions don't call you. You stay in the driver's seat.
* **Minimalist > Bloated:** We provide the foundation. You build the skyscraper.

### Join the Vengeance
Ludas exists to hold your hand and allow you to fly alone. We are building the tools we wish we had when we started, tools that favor the developer over the engine.

**Simple API → Simple Code → Fun Games.**
