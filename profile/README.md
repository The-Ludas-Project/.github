# The Ludas Project
### "Let's go make games."

The Ludas Project was born from a simple realization: the gap between "hardcore graphics programming" and "bloated game engines" has become a canyon. We are here to bridge it.

We believe that game development should be about **logic, creativity, and control**, not fighting with heavy abstractions or mandatory editors.

### The Philosophy
Ludas is more than just code; it is a commitment to a specific way of building:

* **Simple > Clever:** If you can't read it, it doesn't belong here. 
* **Explicit > Magical:** You call the functions; the functions don't call you. You stay in the driver's seat.
* **Minimalist > Bloated:** We provide the foundation. You build the skyscraper.

### Goal
The Ludas Project exists to provide high-quality tools that will assist you every step of the way. The Ludas Project wants to infinitely expand its tool base and grow our ecosystem to new heights. The Ludas-Framework is just the start.

**Simple API → Simple Code → Fun Games.**
